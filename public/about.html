<div class="about">
    <div class="bar">
    <p><strong>I am a self-taught, self-motivated web developer</strong>. I have always had an interest in programming going back over 15 years ago. I received my first certificate degree in software development from North Eastern University in summer of 2001, it encompassed 10 courses over 8 semesters, 6 were programming courses and 4 were computer courses. I tried to seek employment in programming thereafter but was detered due to lack of experience and just wasn't sure it would be the right job for me.
        <br /> At the time i was working as an independent agent for xerox repairing copiers, it seemed at the time that perhaps this is what i really wanted to do, considering i took this job in October of 1999 after working for 16 years in the food service industry i needed a change in scenery. In 2003 i went to Wentworth Institute going for a <strong>bachelors degree in Applied Science in Electronics Engineering</strong>i received my Associates Degree in June 2005, finished up the summer semester but had to leave due to lack of student aid. I have been working as a field engineer since 1999, 3 years ago i was sort of reintroduced to programming by a freind of mine , although i have had some courses on programming in the past, i thought it would be a great idea to rekindle my interest in programming languages. I began taking courses on sites like Udemy.com, Codecademy.com, Udacity, Code School and Edx, just to name a few. I began the freecodecamp's front end developer program in Nov 2015, got my certificate in Feb 2016, then began an online<strong>Mobile Friendly Web Developer</strong> program in April 2016 with Capella University through<strong>Capella Education and Careerbuilder</strong>completed the program and recieved ciertificate in June 2016, I have experience in HTML CSS3, and some experience in Javascript/jQuery. 
       <br /> I have always been a technical person and self-taught learner, in my early years i have build multiple computer systems from scratch, i would also sell some of the systems to by parts and buil a better computer, i have done have done this for bout 5 years, put it aside for other hobbies, then picked it back up in early 2004. In my early years i worked as a gas jockey, mason for 2 years, carpenter for 2 years etc.... I have been through various trade jobs, but none of them were interesting enough to remain employed in them. Long story short, i have decided that programming is what i really want, i now have a love for creating web sites.
        <br /><br />Thank You visiting my site and, reading this exceedingly long page.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to check out my resume, and drop me a line on the contacts page. Cheers Mate!!!</p>
